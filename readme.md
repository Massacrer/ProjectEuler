These solutions are mainly (if not entirely) written in Java, and most of them were coded at around 3am when I was bored. As such, this is not intended to be a showcase of my programming ability - particularly the early efforts - but as a personal progress log of sorts.

As of this writing I intend to redo most of the early programs, and develop and stick to a slightly better personal style than "eclipse auto-format".

If you're reading this, know that I probably hate you. Especially if your name is Josh.
